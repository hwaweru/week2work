        <h2>AKAN NAMING</h2>
        <p>
          The Akan are the largest ethnic group in both Ghana and the Ivory
          Coast. The Akan speak Kwa languages which are part of the larger
          Niger-Congo family. From the 15th century to the 19th century, the
          Akan people dominated gold mining and the gold trade in the region.

      <p>
        The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of
        the week they were born and the order in which they were born. These
        "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and character of
        the person. I have built a web application that takes a user's birthday
        and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on
        their gender outputs their Akan Name.
