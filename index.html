      <h2>AKAN NAMING</h2>
      <p>
        The Akan are the largest ethnic group in both Ghana and the Ivory Coast.
        The Akan speak Kwa languages which are part of the larger Niger-Congo
        family. From the 15th century to the 19th century, the Akan people
        dominated gold mining and the gold trade in the region.

        <p>
          The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day
          of the week they were born and the order in which they were born.
          These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and
          character of the person.This web application takes a user's birthday
          and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending
          on their gender outputs their Akan Name.
