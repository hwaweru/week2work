      <p>
        The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of
        the week they were born and the order in which they were born. These
        "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and character of
        the person. I have built a web application that takes a user's birthday
        and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on
        their gender outputs their Akan Name.
